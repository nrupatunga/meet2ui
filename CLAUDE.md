# Meet2UI Development Guidelines

## UI Development
- Always check that UI elements are properly organized and arranged
- Take screenshots to verify layout after making UI changes
- Ensure all controls (sliders, buttons, labels) are fully visible
- Test at target resolution (640x480) before committing
